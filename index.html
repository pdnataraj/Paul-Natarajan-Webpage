  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro_paragraph">
      Hello World! My name is Paul and I'm currently a 4th Year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Calgary. My interests include a wide array of topics such as embedded electronics, programming and robotics.
    </p>
    <p id="main_paragraph">
        In my spare time, I am involved in a diverse range of projects. For example, I am currently involved with the Calgary branch of TOM (Tikkun Olam Makers), a collaboration of developers and innovators working together to develop open source solutions for the disabled community.
